# Google Merchandise Store - EDA with SQL and Python

The sample dataset contains Google Analytics 360 data (01/08/2016 - 01/08/2017) from the Google Merchandise Store, a real ecommerce store. The goal of this analysis is to address some key questions in marketing/web analytics from different angles such as channel performance in terms of traffic and revenue, individual page performance, and checkout process performance. I mainly used Python Client for BigQuery library along with pandas and matplotlib libraries to extract, query, and visualize data.

In this analysis, I focused on addressing below questions:

* How much traffic did the website get over time?
* Which channel drove the most traffic to the website in 2017?
* Which channel generated the most transactions and revenue in 2017?
* What were the most popular pages in 2017?
* How did the checkout process of Apparel product category perform in 2017?
